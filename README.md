# A2A-Healthcare

# Problem Statement:
Hospitals have many medical devices, but they don’t talk to each other, making it hard to monitor patients in real time and respond quickly to emergencies.

# How A2A Protocol Solves It:
The A2A protocol lets all devices (agents) register, discover each other, and communicate instantly using a standard format. This enables real-time data sharing and alerts across all devices.


# Agents Used:
Patient Monitor Agent: Sends patient vitals and alerts if something is wrong.
Dashboard Agent: Shows all devices and alerts in real time on a central dashboard.


# Project Folder Structure:
app/core/a2a_protocol.py: The protocol logic (register, discover, message passing)
app/devices/patient_monitor.py: The patient monitor agent
app/main.py: The FastAPI backend and dashboard logic
app/templates/dashboard.html: The web dashboard UI
